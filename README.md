# ShoreSquad

## Overview
ShoreSquad is a community-driven initiative aimed at engaging Gen Z youths in Singapore to participate in beach cleanups. Our mission is to promote environmental awareness and foster a sense of responsibility towards our beautiful coastlines.

## Project Structure
The ShoreSquad project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the website.
- `css/styles.css`: The stylesheet that contains the beachy color palette and styles for the website.
- `js/app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles interactive features and user interactions.
- `.gitignore`: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Color Palette
The website utilizes a beachy color palette that resonates with the Gen Z community:
- Ocean Blue: `#0077be`
- Teal: `#009688`
- Sand: `#f4c300`
